# Mini Data Science Projects

This repository contains a collection of mini projects Iâ€™ve worked on to apply and deepen my knowledge in data science. These projects utilize various data science techniques, including bootstrapping, logistic regression, pandas, pruning methods, decision trees, and more.

## Projects Overview

Each project focuses on different aspects of data analysis and machine learning. The goal is to explore these concepts through practical implementation and real-world datasets.

### 1. Bootstrapping
- **Description:** This project demonstrates the use of bootstrapping methods to estimate the distribution of a sample statistic by resampling with replacement.
- **Key Techniques:** Resampling, confidence intervals.

### 2. Logistic Regression
- **Description:** A classification problem solved using logistic regression. The dataset used includes various features to predict a binary outcome.
- **Key Techniques:** Logistic regression, model evaluation, confusion matrix.

### 3. Pandas Data Manipulation
- **Description:** A project focused on mastering data wrangling techniques using pandas. Various data cleaning and transformation tasks were performed on a real-world dataset.
- **Key Techniques:** Dataframes, filtering, aggregation, merging, handling missing data.

### 4. Decision Trees
- **Description:** A decision tree model is built to classify data into categories based on input features.
- **Key Techniques:** Decision trees, entropy, information gain, training, and testing models.

### 5. Pruning Methods
- **Description:** Applied pruning techniques to decision trees to prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization ability.
- **Key Techniques:** Pruning, cross-validation, model optimization.
